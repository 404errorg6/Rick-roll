# Rick-roll
## Intro:
Ever wanted to recreate the rickrolling just for fun or feeling nostalgic of bloody wars of ancient times? Well, this is just the right file for you. With its powers your friends can suffer in infinity(unless they're also tech savvy and know what to do).  
I created this for personal use, but I'm pretty sure there are people out there who have great hobbies like I do so I went to publish it.  
Currently it is only compiled for Windows.
## Working:
The file when executed does the following:
1. Copies itself in the folder: `%APPDATA%/Roaming/YourFavStar/`
2. It create a shortcut of it in startup folder which you can see by writing `startup` in file explorer.
3. After all that, opens rick roll link and sends a message "**You got rickrolled!**"(a decoy).  
Your friend might think it only rickrolls when you execute it, but little do they know...  
It executes itself after every login
#### Best part: 
It's not detected as a malware, because it isn't.
## Removal:
1. Delete the folder: `%APPDATA%/Roaming/YourFavStar/`. 
2. Remove shortcut in startup folder(Again, you can open the startup folder by typing `startup` in file explorer).  
And you're done!
#### It's for fun and trolling only, hope you enjoy it.
